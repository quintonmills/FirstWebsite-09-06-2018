<h1>I was born in a small town called Kokomo Indiana on a cool autumn morning. On September 13th, 2018 my parents gave me the name Quinton Mills. Most of my free time is spent pursuing happiness which includes health, wealth, and relationships in that order. My goal in life is to live a long time and be able to say that I had fun. Thank you for coming to my website.</h1>
